# Makefile Targets
all: creates server and client executables

server: creates server exectubale by linking all object files

server.o: compiles object

dijkstra.o: compiles object

digraph.o: compiles object

client: creates client executables

client.o: compiles object

clean: removes all executables and object files, and unlinks the two pipes

# Running Instructions
Use make with target server to generate the server executable, and then from the
main directors run ./server/server 8888 where 8888 is the port number that
the server and client will use. 

Next use make with target client to generate the
client executable and then from the main directory run ./client/client 8888 127.0.0.1.
These command line arguments give the client the port number and IP address to connect
to. 

Finally, run the plotter exectuable and select points to see the shortest path. This
code was developed using the old version of the plotter so please test using the
previous version.
